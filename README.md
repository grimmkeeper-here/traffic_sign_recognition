# TRAFFIC SIGN LOCALIZATION AND RECOGNITION

Easy way to recognize traffic sign. I use [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html) to find contours for LOCALIZATION and train [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) deep neural network architecture with [German traffic sign system](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset for RECOGNITION.
